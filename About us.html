<p>Faithâ€™s Bakery is a business idea that was founded in 2021, during the time where people needed comfort and connection the most. What started as a small bakery in Cape Town became bigger than what Faith imagined. She began making bread, pastries and cakes as her way to bring joy into the community. The bakery is now known for its dedication to freshness, quality and uniqueness.</p>
